  # All generators have these options:
  # default -> normal terrain generation
  # flat -> normal biomes and foliage, structures, etc but all terrain is the same height (no oceans)
  # perlin -> akin to java amplified
  # void -> no blocks except some critical structures (e.g starting platform, end portal, etc)
  # supervoid -> no blocks whatsoever

  # Overworld also has:
  # superflat -> 1 layer of grass, 3 layers of dirt, stone below that. No features whatsoever
  overworld: default

  # Nether also has:
  # superflat -> netherrack below Y=-128 and above Y=128, air in between
