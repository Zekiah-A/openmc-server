# Super basic repl (read, eval, print, loop) for creating CLIs

## Usage
```js
repl(prefix, handler)
```
### Example
```js
import repl from 'basic-repl'
repl('> ', code => {
	//Eval input and log it
	console.log(eval(code))
})
repl('[server] ', msg => {
	//This repl is for our chat
	//(Let's assume you already made a function chat(){...})
	chat(msg)
	console.log('âœ“ Chat message sent')
})
```
You can switch between multiple repls you have created with `Tab`

## Commonjs

```js
// For compatibility, commonjs works slightly differently
//1. a space is appended to the end of the prefix
//2. the value returned by the function is logged (in ES6 you must console.log() it yourself)
require('basic-repl')('$', code => eval(code))
```
