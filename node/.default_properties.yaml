# Terrain generators
generators:
  # All generators have these options:
  # default -> normal terrain generation
  # flat -> normal biomes and foliage, structures, etc but all terrain is the same height (no oceans)
  # perlin -> akin to java amplified, but goes up & down infinitely and is really smooth
  # fill -> no air besides any naturally forming caves. Also means no grass and no oceans

  # You may force a dimension to generate like another by specifying the dimension to copy before a slash
  # (e.g you could set overworld to nether/flat)

  # You may also set any dimension to "void", where no blocks will naturally generate whatsoever

  # Overworld also has:
  # superflat -> 1 layer of grass, 3 layers of dirt, stone below that. No features whatsoever
  overworld: default

  # Nether also has:
  # superflat -> netherrack below Y=-128 and above Y=128, air in between
  # opensky -> no nether ceiling, giving a similar shape to the overworld
  nether: default

  # flat is almost the same as void
  end: default

  # void is a special dimension, acts as a "spare" dimension for things like map-making
  # The only way to get there is with /tp
  # It doesnt have any of its own generators, so it must borrow from another dimension
